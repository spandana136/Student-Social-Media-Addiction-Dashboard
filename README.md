# Student-Social-Media-Addiction-Dashboard
  This Power BI dashboard analyzes student social media usage, addiction, and its effects on academics, mental health, and sleep. It reveals trends by platform, gender, and country to help educators, counselors, and researchers promote digital wellness and informed interventions.
This Power BI dashboard is developed using a dataset that captures detailed information on student social media usage patterns, levels of addiction, and the resulting impact on academic performance, mental health, and daily routines. The dataset includes responses from students across different countries, academic levels (high school, undergraduate, postgraduate), and genders. Each record highlights how much time a student spends daily on social media, their most-used platform, sleeping habits, relationship status, and whether they feel social media affects their academics or mental health.

The goal of this dashboard is to help stakeholders — including educators, student counselors, researchers, and policy makers — understand key behavioral trends and identify potential risks associated with excessive digital engagement among students.

Key visuals in the report include:

KPI Cards to display average daily usage, addiction scores, and mental health scores.

Pie and Donut Charts that show the distribution of social media platforms and their academic impact.

Stacked and Clustered Column Charts that compare addiction levels across platforms, genders, and academic levels.

Scatter Plots and Maps to examine relationships between addiction, mental health, sleep hours, and geographical location.

Insights gained from the dashboard can be used to:

Highlight the need for digital wellness programs in schools and colleges.

Support students who are experiencing academic decline or mental stress due to excessive screen time.

Guide universities in creating policies around phone use, especially during study hours or in classrooms.

Help families and educators initiate conversations about healthy digital habits.

Overall, this dashboard turns raw survey data into a powerful tool for monitoring and managing social media's influence on students. The insights derived can lead to more targeted interventions, better resource planning, and ultimately, improved student well-being and academic outcomes.
